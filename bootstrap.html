            <p class="card-text">Feeling humiliated, Aju seeks revenge and leads his friends to multiple bars in search of gangsters, eventually befriending Ranga, a prominent, eccentric, and kind-hearted Malayali-Kannadiga gangster in Bangalore who dresses in all-white.

                Disillusioned by Ranga's lack of action, they realize his gang merely praises him while engaging in minor violence. When Bibi confronts Ranga about the incident with Kutty, Ranga unleashes his fury during the college Holi celebration, beating up Kutty and his gang in front of everyone. Despite their initial victory, their association with Ranga begins to consume their lives, affecting their studies. They face expulsion after being unable to pass exams but are given a second chance, with assurances of passing all future exams. The trio's troubles escalate when they are kidnapped by Reddy, Ranga's former boss.
                
                Reddy accuses Ranga of identity theft and seeks their help to eliminate him. Fleeing from Reddy's threats, they discover a grim truth in the house provided by Ranga. The trio meets Ranga and expresses their desire to sever ties with him, revealing that they only befriended him for revenge.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Mallikajaan (Manisha Koirala) wakes up late night to find her newborn son missing. When she searches in Shahi Mahal, she finds that her son has been sold to a nawab by her sister, Rehana (Sonakshi Sinha). When she confronts Rehana over it, she coldly admits that she did it for money, and that as a tawaif's son, Malika's son wouldn't have had a good life anyway.


                To extract revenge, Mallika murders Rehana and with the help of her patron Zulfikar, frames it as a suicide. Her other sister Waheeda (Sanjeeda Sheikh) is aware of this, so Zulfikar slashes at her face with a pen, permanently scarring her. Malika warns Waheeda to not tell the truth to anybody and gives her the documents of Rehana's death to destroy. However, Waheeda preserves them in an opportunity to use this against Mallika later. Mallika then sells off Rehana's daughter, Fareedan, and becomes the Huzoor (madame) of Heeramandi.</p>

            <p class="card-text">n 2001 in the fictional Nirmal Pradesh, Deepak, a farmer, is travelling back to his village with his new bride, Phool. They get into a crowded passenger train along with many other newlywed couples. The brides all wear the same-colored attire with their faces completely covered with a veil as is the tradition. Deepak dozes off and wakes up in the night to realize that he has arrived at his destination. In the darkness and confusion from the rush to leave, he disembarks with the wrong bride and Phool is left behind on the train.

                The couple is welcomed by his family only to be shocked when they realize it is the wrong bride. Her real name is Jaya but she gives them a false name and lies about where she is from. Meanwhile, at a different station, Phool realizes the mixup but the station master is unable to help her due to her not knowing the name of Deepak's village. She also refuses to go back home, not wanting to bring shame to her family. She decides to stay at the station in case Deepak comes looking, and is helped by Manju Mai, who runs a tea stand on the platform.</p>
